## Overview

This is a World Cup Database project built using **PostgreSQL**. It demonstrates a relational database design that models international football tournaments, including teams, games, and tournament rounds. The schema captures meaningful relationships between teams and matches throughout World Cup history.

Users can interact with the database using SQL queries to retrieve match results, analyze team performance, and explore tournament outcomes. The final deliverable is a complete SQL dump file (`worldcup.sql`) representing the full database structure and its seeded data.

## About

This project is part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) **Relational Database Certification**. It helped me practice essential database skills including:

- Creating and modifying tables  
- Establishing primary and foreign key relationships  
- Writing efficient `INSERT` statements  
- Querying data to answer analytical questions  
- Structuring normalized schemas for real-world event data  

The project provided hands-on experience with PostgreSQL and reinforced foundational database concepts in a sports analytics context.
